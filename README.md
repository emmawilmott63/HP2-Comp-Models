# Computational Models
### Oscillations
Computational models made to simulate and solve problems involving various oscillating systems. Models are based on difference equations and a simple Euler's method solution, though analytical solutions do exist. 
### Atmosphere
Computational models made to simulate blackbodies and determine their temperature. Models begin with the assumption of Earth as a blackbody and grow in complexity. 


*Before making calculations or creating graphs, always reset experimental conditions by running the cell containing experimental constants.


*These are stand-alone models with no conceptual explanation and assume background knowledge from the viewer.

# Computational Models
These are stand-alone computational models made in jupyter notebook. The notebooks do not include the theory behind the models, and assume that the viewer already has the background physics knowledge to understand and use them.
### Oscillations
Computational models made to simulate and solve problems involving various oscillating systems. Models are based on difference equations and a simple Euler's method solution, though analytical solutions do exist. 
### Atmosphere
Computational models made to simulate blackbodies and determine their temperature. Models begin with the assumption of Earth as a blackbody and grow in complexity. 


*Before making calculations or creating graphs, always reset experimental conditions by running the cell containing experimental constants.
